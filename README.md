# Personal-Project---EDA-Salary-Data

This is the repo for my personal project, as part of practice upon Exploratory Data Analysis lesson.
The dataset is about salary data in a company, in preparation for the Tax report.

The dataset column is in Indonesian, and I'm not changing column name. So here's the rough translation:
- `Masa Perolehan Awal` = Employee join month
- `Masa Perolehan Akhir` = Employee exit month
- `NIP` = Employee identification number
- `Jenis Kelamin` = Gender
- `Status PTKP` = Marriage status: K = Married, TK = Not Married
- `Jumlah Tanggungan` = Amount of dependence
- `Gaji Pokok dan Tunjangan Tetap` = Net Salary and Fixed Allowance
- `Tunjangan lain (Variabel)` = Other Allowance
- JKK & JKM & BPJS Kesehatan` = Health Insurance
- `THR dan Bonus` = Bonus / Holiday Allowance
- `Tunjangan PPh` = Tax Allowance
- `Jumlah Penghasilan Bruto` = Gross Income

Points to be analysis and EDA result will be provided in Rmd file.
Some important notes:
1. The original dataset has been manipulated to hide confidential data
2. In actual the rule or Tax is more complicated. Some has been simplified here just for the practice sake.
